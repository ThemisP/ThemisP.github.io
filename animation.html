                Using Autodesk Maya to create and animate a robot. The process is separated into two sections. The first

                them to form the robot. The second section is the process of adding a skeleton to the robot (rigging)
                and making a dance animation. Both sections have a small ~20second video.

                                powerful way of narrowing down the ideas for the character to be used. It helped forge
                                the
                                idea of the character, the body parts required, the motion those body parts would
                                provide
                                and bring the character to life. One of the sketches is shown in Figure 1.

                                <strong>Challenges and Highlights: </strong>
                                In the process of creating an immersive animation, a number of different techniques and
                                animation processes were used. Examples include Set-driven keys, Post-infinity curves,
                                Graph editor manipulation, Constraints, Disney's Animation Principles, and Camera Motion
                                smoothing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Set driven keys were used to extend and contract the robots extension parts shown in
                                Figure 2.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Post-infinity curves were used to animate the gears of the robot's "heart" for non-stop
                                motion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Constraints added to separate body parts, so that they follow the motion of others such
                                as the hand following the extension of the other body parts without breaking, shown in
                                Figure 4.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using Disney's animation principle to add anticipation when legs and arms contract in
                                the animation, they first extend showing the something will happen, and when they
                                contract they do in a spring-like manner. In Figure 3, anticipation is demonstrated by
                                the initial rise of the graph, and then the spring dampening effect is shown in the
                                oscillations close to the end.

                finishing pose as an outro. In addition, I added simple textures to the robot to make him more

                    <strong>Pre-production and planning: </strong>
                    As with the first section of the project, some preparation before I dive straight into Maya was
                    carried out. First of all selecting the music that the robot would dance to, then creating a small
                    animation script and lastly describing the location helped identify some very simple props I could
                    use to make the atmosphere and the look of the animation better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weighted rigging: </strong>
                    Initially, when starting to add joints to the structure of the character, I came across an obstacle.
                    I modeled every other part of the character as separate objects except the hand. The hand was a
                    single object. I started working in adding weighted rig bones to the hand (Figure 5) but shortly
                    realized that having weighted skinned joints parented under unskinned joints would become a very
                    unstable way of working, and would become an issue in the future. I soon deleted the hand and
                    created a new model splitting the fingers into many different objects (Figure 6) to keep the
                    consistency of the model throughout.

                <li>
                    <strong>Inverse Kinematics: </strong>
                    There were two major ways to rig the model and add motion. Either Forward kinematics or inverse
                    kinematics. Inverse kinematics initially seemed easier and simpler, just move one control and the
                    joints will animate accordingly. Soon after starting to animate, I realized that the motion inverse
                    kinematics provide is limited and most of the time unnatural.  This led me to do more research
                    before continuing, and after some reading and rethinking, I changed the arms of the robot to forward
                    kinematics and kept the legs of the robot as inverse kinematics. Inverse kinematics are very good
                    when you want to animate something attached to something else, e.g. the legs to the ground, that way
                    you can move your character but the legs will still be stuck correctly to the ground.

                            Animating a skeleton turned out to be very messy and often confusing. Therefore after
                            looking at other peoples work and researching basic principles online, I started cleaning up
                            my model and adding controls to the joints that I wanted to animate Figures 8 and 9 show the
                            control circles and control points attached to the joints that would be animated, and Figure
                            7 shows the hierarchy of objects and bones when they were all renamed and structured
